The Node.js `https` module is a built-in module that allows you to make secure HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) requests to servers. It provides a way to communicate securely over the internet by encrypting the data transmitted between the client and the server using SSL/TLS protocols.

Here's a very simple usage example of the `https` module in Node.js:

```javascript
const https = require('https');

const options = {
  hostname: 'api.example.com',
  path: '/data',
  method: 'GET'
};

const req = https.request(options, (res) => {
  let data = '';

  res.on('data', (chunk) => {
    data += chunk;
  });

  res.on('end', () => {
    console.log(data);
  });
});

req.on('error', (error) => {
  console.error(error);
});

req.end();
```

A package called `https`, however, also exists on npm:

%[https://www.npmjs.com/package/https] 

The `https` package has last been published 8 years ago. Looking at the package contents, we can see that it contains just the manifest file, and no actual code:

```json
{
  "name": "https",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "https mediation",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "https",
    "mediation"
  ],
  "author": "hardus van der berg <hardus@sunfork.com> (http://www.sunfork.com)",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

It looks like a simple, useless package until we see that [over 1600 other packages depend on it](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/https) directly, and many more depend on it indirectly, without even knowing. This is probably the result of maintainers not being aware that `https` is internal to Node, and thinking they need to install it - it's also been asked on StackOverflow [multiple](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12028046/npm-install-https) [times](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27376713/nodejs-npm-install-https-not-working).

Node's `require` will [load built-in modules first](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_all_together), so even if code would be included in a new version of the npm `https` package, it would never run via a simple `require('https')`. **The danger of having** `https` **in your list of dependencies rather comes from the possibility of the package being reactivated with a new version that contains install scripts.** We've written before about how install scripts can be dangerous:

%[https://blog.sandworm.dev/dissecting-npm-malware-five-packages-and-their-evil-install-scripts] 

The `https` package currently gets more than 500,000 downloads per week. At any moment in the future, publishing a `1.0.1` version with malicious install scripts would enable potential attackers to access a great number of development and build machines, to steal information or install arbitrary software.

The [Sandworm](https://sandworm.dev/) team has reached out to the package maintainers and authors that currently rely on `https` to suggest they remove it from their dependencies.
